<h3>...Once the most popular DNN tooltips module</h3>

Handy Tips is a DNN Skin Object which replaces DNN Labels (that have help strings) with nice tooltips 
based on jQuery plugin BeautyTips. Additionally, it allows creating new tooltips for any control on the page.

<h3>Why is Handy Tips FREE?</h3>

Why not? Because it's awesome for you. And we are the mystical kind of guys and we believe in the "spirit" of sharing. 
There can't be anything wrong with that, can it?

In any case, we do not have the time to maintain and support Handy Tips anymore. We have a lot of cool features to add
to our popular DNN modules such as:

We’re opening up our roadmap for the community to make decisions with us. So, the future of Handy Tips is in your hands!

This means you’ll have a collaborative codebase which gives you the ability to contribute to the source. Great, isn't it?!
